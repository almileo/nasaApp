NasaApp

This is a simple SPA (Single Page Application) to connect to NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/) to show Mars Rovers Photos.

First you have to select between 3 rovers Curiosity, Opportinity and Spirit.

Once you've selected one rover, it will show the latest photos of it. 

From there you can filter by Sol (with an input like i.e. '1200') or Earth Date using the datepicker.

Also, you can filter the photos by the camera of the rover.

The pictures will be displayed by 25 each page.
